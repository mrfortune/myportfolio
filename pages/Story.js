<p class="mt-3">My degree in business trained me to think about marketing, management, statistics, and the challenges involved with succeeding in business. I learned to develop websites, and then I learned online video production, photography and how to translate designs into code. At Showtime I was tasked with editing clips weekly for our series shows using Final Cut Pro and other video processing/streaming  tools. I have also taken a course in editing using Premier. But, with these skills, I would always find myself asking “why?”. UX Design methodologies, skills, thinking, language and processes has provided me with the approach to get those answers and create greater questions.</p>
