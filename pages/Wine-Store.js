                My journey of discovery began on Easter Sunday, April 2021, where I organized a dinner party with a group of women ranging in age from 30-45. My first insight was that all of the women ordered their wine form various local wine stores but all of them were order by their mobile phones. 
                I asked them about their experience with buying wine and how they normally go about the process. We talked about the the websites of local retailers and what they felt about the sites.</Typography>

    <Typography variant="h2">Tell Us How To Architect</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">Through the closed card-sort process users gave me insights into how the navigation should be organized. I gave  users specific wines from multiple countires and categories to place the 75 wines items into. I designed our navigation, search filters and pages from these insights. The choice of using a closed sort was to limit the categories to how wines are grouped in the industry by professionals.
